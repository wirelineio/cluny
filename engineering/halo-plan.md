# Halo Wallet Support

## Background

Blockchain wallets such as Metamask and Lunie act as a trusted enclave for one or more private keys that are used to sign blockchain transactions under the direction of a host web application. HALO uses signed messages that function as cryptographic credentials for the purpose of defining authority over access control to a shared database called a Party.
